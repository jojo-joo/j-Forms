## Goals

In embedded development, web development typically exhibits the following characteristics:

1. **Simplicity:** Pages are generally quite simple, focusing mainly on form submissions. Responsable UI is not required, little controls 
2. **Resource Constraints:** Resources are extremely limited, including memory and processing power.
3. **Low Aesthetic Requirements:** Pages need to be neat and concise, with minimal focus on aesthetics.
4. **Comprehensive Responsibility:** Due to the unique nature of the hardware, the front-end, communication protocols, and back-end processing are usually handled by embedded engineers, resulting in a substantial workload.

To provide embedded engineers with a solution that is tidy, fast, simple, and robust, a framework called j-form has been developed to achieve the following objectives:

1. **Unified Style Form Controls:** Over 50 form controls with a unified style.
2. **Lightweight Framework:** A framework size of less than 100KB, utilizing front-end browser resources for validation.
3. **Builtin Style Support:** Support for VUE, MATERIAL, and BOOTSTRAP styles.
4. **Automatic Code Generation:** Definition of data formats, with automatic generation of front-end, protocol, and back-end code.
